Fitness Tracker Backend Development Summary

Today, we worked on developing the backend for our AI-powered fitness tracking platform. This platform is designed to help users monitor their workouts, track fitness progress, and receive personalized recommendations based on their activity levels. Our backend is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with secure authentication handled through JWT and bcrypt.

Key Features Implemented:

User Authentication: Implemented secure login and registration using JWT authentication and password hashing with bcrypt.

Middleware Implementation: Created authentication middleware to protect routes and prevent unauthorized access.

User Data Management: Developed APIs to handle user profiles, including storing personal fitness metrics like height, weight, fitness level, and activity preferences.

Error Handling & Debugging: Addressed issues where request bodies were empty, ensuring proper parsing using Express middleware (express.json and express.urlencoded).

CORS and Security Enhancements: Configured CORS to allow secure communication between the frontend and backend.

Logging & Debugging: Implemented console logging for better debugging of incoming requests.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an AI/ML-powered fitness tracking system that can analyze user activities, provide motivational feedback, and recommend personalized workout plans to help users stay fit. We are continuously working on optimizing the backend and integrating advanced features to enhance user experience.
